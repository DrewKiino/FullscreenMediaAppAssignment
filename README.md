Fullscreen Media App Assignment
by: Andrew Aquino

Requirementss:

"Can you create a small app that pulls images and videos from an Instagram Feed (can be your own test userâ€™s feed) and Flickr popular feed, then display them in a table view or collection view? (Flickr and Instagram feed can be in a separate table/collection view)

Here are some of the requirements:
- The app should build and run on the latest Xcode
- The app should have a mechanism to refresh the feed
- The app should have pagination support
- It would be a huge plus if you can include video playback support
- Be creative and have fun!"

Developer Notes:

* the app contains two screens, one to showcase Instagram's user feed and the other to showcase the user's Flickr interesting feed. 
* you have to hit "Connect" then login when the browser comes up to connect accounts
* to login into Flickr, login first then after you are sent back to the app, exit the browser, press "connect" again to authorize. (2 step verification for OAuth)
* the app also contains paging and refresh functionalities for both feed including video playback
